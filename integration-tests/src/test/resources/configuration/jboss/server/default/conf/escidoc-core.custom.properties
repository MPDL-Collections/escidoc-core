# PID behavior

# This should be part of the content model; meanwhile
# the behavior is defined here on instance level. You
# can define different behaviors for items and containers.
# Additionally, you may differentiate between Object PIDs 
# and Version PIDs. 
# 
# setPidBeforeRelease : Allow PID setting before an object/version is released
# setPidAfterRelease  : Allow PID setting after an object/version is released
# releaseWithoutPid   : Allow release of an object/version without PID
