		The System is able to manage statistic-scopes. 
		Statistic-Scopes divide the overall-statistics into areas 
		of responsibility. Statistic-record writing, aggregation of 
		data and report-generation only runs within a defined statistic-scope.
		Therefore, every xml-structure has a mandatory element 'scope' with an attribute objid where
		the objid of the scope has to be provided.		
	</para>
	<para>
		Parameters and return-values of the interface-calls are xml-records according to 
		the scope-schema. The xml-record contains the root-element with an attribute objid 
		that defines the primary-key of the scope 
		and a subelement name that holds the name of the scope.
