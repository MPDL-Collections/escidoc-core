  <title>Introduction [Handler Objects]</title>

  <para>A handler object exists for each base resource. Each handler object
  provides methods to create, retrieve, update, and delete resources and their
  subresources. With the exception of the create method, all methods require a
  unique identifier to select a single resource.</para>

  <para>Each handler object defines a service interface which is described in
  the WSDL. For exception handling, method names, and information about
  retrieving the service description, see the interface specification of the
  resources.</para>

    <title>Exception handling</title>

    <para>SOAP uses WSDL definitions of the services. The WSDL definitions
    specify how the request and the response of a service must look, including
    possible exceptions. There are various tools on the market that can
    generate Java objects out of a WSDL (for example, wsdl2java from the
    axis-framework). The response can automatically populate these Java
    objects by binding them to the specific responses. This enables an
    application to work with objects and not with XML. A Java application can
    now directly handle the eSciDoc exceptions by catching the generated
    exceptions. For further information on error and exception handling inside
    the infrastructure, please refer to the section on exception handling -
    <xref linkend="MHo06" /> - and to the WSDL files that are provided.</para>

  <section id="Overview.AccessToResourceHandlers">
    <title>Access to the Resource Handlers</title>

    <para>All supported resources are accessible via SOAP. All available
    methods to manipulate a certain resource via SOAP are described in the
    document dedicated to this resource. Each resource offers its own SOAP
    service and has a WSDL interface description - for example, the methods of
    the item resource are accessible by the ItemHandlerService. The names of
    these services are listed in the description of the SOAP calls of the
    methods.</para>

  <section id="Overview.WorkWithSubResources">
    <title>Working with Subresources</title>

    <para>Every resource offers the facility to access its data by addressing
    subresources. For example, it is possible to retrieve and update a single
    metadata record of an item instead of retrieving and updating the whole
    item to correct a typo in the title.</para>

    <para>To achieve the best performance in working with the eSciDoc
    infrastructure and to minimize the arising overhead, it is helpful to use
    the offered subresources to retrieve and update the required data.</para>
