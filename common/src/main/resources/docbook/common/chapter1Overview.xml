		Each resource has a URI represented via XLink and is
		accessible with Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP
		request methods are used to distinguish between create
		(PUT), update (PUT), retrieve (GET), and delete (DELETE). In
		order to create or update a resource the representation of
		that resource as a valid XML document has to be send in the
		request body. There is a restriction of the total size of
		that body.
	</para>
	<para>
		In case of an error the answer contains a HTTP status code
		indicating the type of the error, a short description and a
		XML representation of the error. The XML representation of
		an error is described in XMLSchema [TODO document name].

		<title>Retrieve a resource</title>
		<para>
			Send a HTTP GET request to the URI of the resource. The
			response to a HTTP GET request contains the HTTP status
			code 200 ("OK") and the XML representation of the
			resource in the response body.

		<title>Create or Update a resource</title>
		<para>
			Send a HTTP PUT request to the URI of the resource. The
			body of the request must contain the XML representation
			of the resource and the value of the Content-Type header
			of the HTTP PUT request must be "text/xml". The HTTP
			status code of the response to a HTTP PUT request is 200
			("OK"). The response body contains the new or updated
			XML representation of the resource.
		</para>

	<formalpara>
		<title>Delete a resource</title>
		<para>
			Send a HTTP DELETE request to the URI of the resource.
			If successful the response to the HTTP DELETE request
			contains the HTTP status code 204 ("NO CONTENT") and no
			body.

		<para>
			A REST request is submitted to eSciDoc by using the HTTP
			Protocol. If the execution of a request is errouneos an
			Exception is thrown. In this case the HTTP response
			status code is set to the http status code defined for
			this the exception, e.g. 404 if a resource was not found
			by the infrastructure. The text of the HTTP response will be
			an xml-representation of the exception. The possible
			status codes (combined with the causing exception) are
			listed in the documentaion of a REST method call. In the
			rare case the infrastructure is not able to map a request to
			a specific resource method a MethodNotFoundException
			(404, "Method Not Found") is thrown and send back in the
			HTTP response. For further information on error and
			exception handling inside the infrastructure please refer to
			the concept on exception handling
