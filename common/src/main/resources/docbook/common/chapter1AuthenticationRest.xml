  <title>Authentication and Authorization</title>

  <para>Access to most of the eSciDoc services is protected. User requests
  must be authorized before they are granted. Authorization occurs through
  verification of a user's eSciDoc handle, which authenticates a user's
  account within eSciDoc. </para>

  <para>Exceptions are the search service and the StatisticDataHandler, which
  are unprotected. Anyone is allowed to perform a search request and create
  statistical data records.</para>

  <para>When authentication of a user fails, the eSciDoc responds with a
  redirect request to the eSciDoc user management wrapper, which provides the
  user with a login prompt.</para>

  <para><emphasis role="bold">Providing the eSciDoc User
  Handle</emphasis></para>

  <para>The eSciDoc user handle must be provided within a cookie named
  <emphasis>escidocCookie</emphasis>.</para>

  <para>The following example shows how the eSciDoc user handle can be
  provided within the escidocCookie cookie. This Java example assumes the
  usage of the http client from the apache jakarta project.</para>

    <title>Handling URL parameters</title>

    <para>URL parameters are not evaluated by the base services. But if any
    URL parameter is found in a GET or a HEAD request--for example, the
    parameter eSciDocUserHandle from the login servlet-- a redirect response
    to the same URL without these parameters is sent back. This is done to
    prevent security information from being shown in the URL field of a
    browser that directly connects to the base services.</para>
